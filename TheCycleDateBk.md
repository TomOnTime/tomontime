# Pimlico Software's DateBk 6 #

These settings are what I use to configure my Palm Treo [DateBk6 for Palm OS](http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/datebk6.htm) so that it is optimized for using The Cycle.

With this configuration:

  * The normal view will be a split-screen showing your top priority todo's and a little bit of today's schedule.
  * Todo list will be sorted with work-stuff first, then Personal stuff.  At the end of the day bump all unfinished Business todos to the next day and you are ready to start your personal (or "at night") Todos.

# Procedures #

  * **Record new "todo" item**:
    * Click "New" then "Todo" then enter the item.  Default priorities and categories should be ok.  If it is something you want to do after work, when you get home, change Category to "Personal".
  * **Putting off low-priority items**:
    * Click the item and HOLD.  A pop-up will appear.  Click "Set Tomorrow" or "Set Next Monday" (moves it to the beginning of next week).
  * **Mark a todo item as "done"**:
    * Click the item and HOLD.  A pop-up will appear.  Click "Toggle Done".  It will be properly recorded as "done today".

# Configuring the software #

There is the main preferences menu (that leads to many different screens of options) and the "View Display Options" page.  I don't know why DB splits them into different areas.  Alas, here are my settings. (In most cases I've only listed the ones that are ON or checked.)

TODO(tlim): Just list what's different from the defaults.
