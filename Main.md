## Palm ##

Back when I had a Palm Treo I swore by Pimlico's DateBk6 (I started with DateBk4 and upgraded through to the last release)

  * [DateBook6](http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/datebk6.htm) by PIMLICO Software.  Turns a Palm-based PDA into something powerful enough to use The Cycle System.  TheCycleAndDateBook explains how to configure it to do The Cycle.
