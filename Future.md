# How to report a bug or typo #

O'Reilly has a great system for reporting bugs.  I get email notifications, approve the suggestions, and
the next printing incorporates the changes.

# Thoughts about future editions #

I'm surprised at how well the book continues to be a favorite book among sysadmins even though it was written in 2005 when the coolest SmartPhone was
a Palm Treo and there was no such thing as an iPhone or Android.  It is starting to show its age.  When you read it, just replace any references to PDA with "SmartPhone".

I'm busy with other, more pressing, projects at the moment. However, here is a list of ideas I've had or have been suggested to me
for what the 2nd edition would look like:

## Modernize it ##

  * Replace all PDA examples with iPhone and Android examples.
  * Usefull new technology... online Todo-Lists like RememberTheMilk or ToodleDo: I use RememberTheMilk not only for Todos and suchlike, but also have configured my monitoring system to send alerts there - if something breaks down, it automatically ends up on my Todo list.
  * Include tips on the benefits of shared calendar systems (How people use multiple Google Calendars, merge them, etc)
  * Include tips on the benefits of shared todo systems.

## New advice ##

  * Your "invest 5 minutes" doesn't have to be done at the office.  I do my "invest 5" on the train as I commute every day.  Works great for me because I live in NJ and work in NYC.
  * in Chapter 13 section "How to Automate", "Step 1: Do It Manually" - the most obvious tool for this is the shell history but it goes unmentioned. I should also point out the "script" command in unix and other similar things in Windows.

## Fan-suggested advice ##

  * "Eat the worm": pick a task that I dread, that I've been procrastinating, and do that first thing in the morning. (submitted by mec)
